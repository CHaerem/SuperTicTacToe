## How to Play

Super Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3x3 grid of Tic Tac Toe boards. Here are the basic rules:

1. Each turn, you mark a square in one of the smaller 3x3 boards.
2. Your move determines which board your opponent plays in next.
3. Win three smaller boards in a row to win the game.

The game adds an extra layer of strategy to the classic Tic Tac Toe, as you need to think about both the immediate board and the overall game.
